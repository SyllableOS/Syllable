* January 9, 2009, Kaj de Vos *

Added experimental support for installing from and to USB memory devices
to the installer and GrUB menus.

* December 27, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Patch for p7zip to workaround double-initialization of signatures.

* December 15, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Added 'swap left & right mousebuttons' pref to appserver; thanks to Adam.

* December 15, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Added Russian translation of the welcome document, from Alexander "azlk".

* December 12, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Upgraded SDL to 1.2.13 from patches by Rui Caridade.
Upgraded SDL-Image to 1.2.7, SDL-Net to 1.2.7 and SDL-Sound to 1.0.3.

* November 29, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Modified os::Resources to internally use std::vector< ResourceDesc* >
instead of std::vector< ResourceDesc >; this bypasses the strange rescopy crash.

Removed the default parameter from MessageQueue::FindMessage() to remove
the ambiguity.

* October 24, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixed a couple of stupid errors in libpthread where || (Boolean OR) had been
transposed for && (Boolean AND) causing some simple sanity checks to fail.

* October 8, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Standardised main documentation location, from /atheos/Documentation/ and
/boot/Documentation/ on Desktop and /Documentation/ on Server, to /documentation/.
This also gets rid of the last use of the /atheos/ symlink.
Added a Documentation/ symlink in the desktop templates to /documentation/.

* October 7, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added os::Directory::SetPath(). Patch from
Dee Sharpe <demetrioussharpe@netscape.net>

* September 29, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Updated the default content for home directories: browser bookmarks, desktop links
and filetype associations.

* September 5, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

The main documentation files are now pulled from the websites, so they are first
processed by the content management system. The FAQ is now also included in
/Documentation/, and the new translated documentation.

Added ReadLine to the build at a tip from Anthony and made BASh use this external
version. The added value is that INetUtils FTP now also uses it.

* August 23, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Introduced a symlink /resources/ to /usr/. This will serve the migration in the
coming time of resource packages to /resources/, which is a much clearer name and
separates our packages from the legacy content of /usr/ (Unix System Resources).
I chose the most fitting of those three words to describe our packages.

* August 14, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Added a number of extra GrUB entries to the install CD for hardware testing, known
emulator configurations and serial debugging.

Used Anthony's sysinfo extension in the installer to find out the kernel parameters
that the install CD was booted with and propagate any extra parameters into the
GrUB menu of the installation.

* August 4, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

OpenSSH has been included in the base distribution a few dev builds ago.
NetCat was also added some time ago.

Another addition is TINY, a REBOL/ORCA library factored out of Builder.
It's not fully ready yet, but is already used in the content management system
of the web sites for data access and parsing and templating.

Some useful data has also been added:
/etc/mime.types is a simple standard database for programs to determine the MIME types
of files based on their name extensions.
/etc/ssl/certs/ is a collection of well-known security certificates published by
Certification Authorities, used by many network programs for authentication.
Configurations were added for a number of popular servers: INetUtils FTPD, VSFTPD,
OpenSSH, BIND, RSync and Apache. These work on Server, but not all of them work on
Desktop yet.
Another configuration was added for S3Sync, a tool to synchronise files with Amazon S3.

* August 3, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Fixed Winter, Blue and Warpspeed decorators.
Added unload_decorator() method to appserver decorator API.

* July 12, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Updated sysinfo to use new get_system_info() version.
Make 'strace --help' work.
Corrections to dhcpc as pointed out by c0x.

* July 8, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added three new AGP GART HCD drivers for ALi, nVidia & SiS chipsets. All
drivers are from Dee Sharpe.

* June 6, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added an AGP bus manager and Via AGP GART HCD driver. All of this is from Dee
Sharpe <demetrioussharpe@netscape.net>

* May 1, 2008, Anthony Morphett *

Documentation updates and bugfixes for BitmapImage relating to
Bitmap::SHARE_FRAMEBUFFER flag

* April 22, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Patches from Anthony Morphett

 o Make the mousewheel work properly in DropdownMenus
 o Make ctrl+home, ctrl+end, shift+ctrl+home, shift+ctrl+end work properly in
   AEdit and TextViews

* April 15, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Detect the Intel i945GME chip with the i855 driver.

* April 11, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Gave priority to the resource packages installed in /usr/ over software installed in
/usr/local/. This means that you can port software according to its standard instructions,
and then later install an official package for it in /usr/ without having to painfully
delete the scattered files under /usr/local/.

* March 24, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated the GeForceFX driver with PCI IDs for newer cards. Untested. Patch from
Alexandru Mizeranschi <lexu_85@yahoo.com>

* March 9, 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Some patches from Anthony Morphett

o An improved shutdown tool to do a clean shutdown via the appserver. This is intended
  to replace the current shutdown and reboot tools which don't give apps a chance to
  quit cleanly.
o In the mouse prefs app, the doubleclick speed values it was setting were off by a
  factor of 100, so even the slowest speed was way to fast to be usable. Also the
  doubleclick slider wasn't initially being set to the right value.
o Make lsattribs and dumpattribs work with read-only filesystems. Currently they open
  the file O_RDWR which fails on read-only filesystems; changed to O_RDONLY.

* January 12 2008, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

A bunch of PThreads improvements:

o Implemented thread cancellation. pthread_cancel() & pthread_testcancel() now work.
o Defined SIGCANCEL using the (unused) signal # used for SIGWINCH
o The type for pthread_t has changed from a simple int to a more complex struct pointer.
  A pthread_t variable can now be used to access the associated pthread_attr_t. This is
  used in E.g. pthread_join() where the target thread is checked to ensure it is
  joinable.
o As a result of the above change and an additional change to pthread_attr_t the
  library version has been incremented.
o Change setstackaddr() & setstacksize() to always return ENOSYS
o Implement getstack() fully and a stub for setstack() that always returns ENOSYS
o Define PTHREAD_STACK_MIN instead of the private __DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE
o Implemented pthread_sigmask()
o A handful of bug fixes and additional checks have been added to make libpthread more
  POSIX compliant.

These changes have all been tested using the OpenPosix Test Suite.

---- 0.6.5 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* January 2, 2008, Kaj de Vos *

Moved files for software development (headers, static libraries and development
documentation) into a new, separate area in /system/development/resources/.
They have to be registered in /system/indexes/ separately after system installation.
Moved the system headers to /system/development/headers/.

* December 23, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

A bunch of updates to libdl & libpthread:

o dlerror() returns NULL if no error has been set since the last call to dlerror()
  This makes dlerror() POSIX compliant and fixes a bug loading dynamic objects in
  Glib.
o Fixed a few return values in some stub functions and pthread_cond_timedwait() now
  returns ETIMEDOUT instead of -ETIMEDOUT.
o Added debugging statements and asserts to libpthread, which can all be enabled or
  disabled at build time.

* December 15, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

o One more fix to libdl: don't try to free the handle in dlclose()
o Remove the unneeded debug output from afs_truncate()

* November 26, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Fixed execution of the early init scripts, and thereby initialisation of the terminal.

* November 25, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Moved essential packages to the new system area, to protect them from regular software
maintenance activities in /usr/. The idea is that regular user actions will not leave
the system unbootable, and a protected system environment will keep allowing basic
operation of the system to repair any damage.

* November 22, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixed dlopen() so that it correctly returns NULL if the library could not be
opened. I've also done a quick cleanup and removed an unnescary malloc() that
was also a memory leak.

* November 12, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Introduced an extra symlinked package pool for system resources.

I have thought many years about the desirability of versioned package installations.
It seemed a powerful thing to be able to install multiple versions of a package.
However, it would also complicate our package symlink system quite a bit, because
multiple versions of the same file would be allowed and would have to be managed.
And when it comes down to it, the only parts of a package that are properly versioned
and can be used next to each other are shared libraries. These are essential, because
we are shipping compatibility versions of older libraries. For using complete packages
in place of another version provided in the system, the method Builder uses by placing
another package pool first in all the search paths has turned out to be convenient.
As a matter of psychology, allowing multiple package versions in the main system could
easily lead users to install too many versions, and developers to link programs to
non-standard library versions that are not available on other people's configurations
(as observed in other systems).

This matter needed a solution now, because Linux is not as flexible with shared libraries
as Syllable. The method we used to move the core C and C++ libraries to /system/libraries/
breaks on Linux, because it does not allow moving the shared system libraries after
compilation. At first I just left GLibC and GCC in /usr/, but this is undesirable because
they are not protected there from a user overwriting them and leaving the system unusable.

I have implemented the following solution. The default package pool in /usr/ is still
available, unversioned. However, I have moved all packages with shared libraries that
are part of the core system to an extra, versioned package pool in /system/resources/.
The symlinks are in /system/indexes/. The new ORCA Packager was already able to handle
multiple pools. It did not have to be extended, because multiple versions of the same
file are still not allowed in the system pool. If multiple versions of a package are
installled, only a subset consisting of their shared libraries is supported, for shipping
older versions for backward compatibility. Library versions are now easy to manage,
because they are in their own subdirectories.

* September 23, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Implemented PkgConfig support. The base PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable is set in /etc/profile
and Builder extends it to its staging areas.

* August 30, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Moved loose documentation files in ports to "documentation" subdirectories.

* August 27, 2007, Arno Klenke *

Use lock_semaphore()/unlock_semaphore() instead of sleep_on_sem()/wakeup_sem()
in the usb busmanager and disk driver to avoid lockups.
Fixed libusb code.

Added a driver for the s3 deltachrome card. Only bios based modesetting is supported.

* August 17, 2007, Flemming H. SÃ¸rensen *

Added Greek.
Fixed a problem with the ColdFish locale-catalog.

* August 14, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Included SDL_ttf, now that the new version builds with new FreeTypes.

* August 13, 2007, Arno Klenke *

Corrected area flags in the audio drivers

* July 28, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added support for userspace USB via. libusb. The USB bus manager will now
export device nodes under /dev/usb/[bus #]/[device #] which are used by libusb
to access the device.

* July 18, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Set network to DHCP by default on eth0.

---- 0.6.4 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

Started to move the application list handling into the registrar

---- 0.6.3 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* February 24, 2007, Flemming H. SÃ¸rensen *

Localized PrintQueue.

* February 21, 2007, Flemming H. SÃ¸rensen *

The language-lists in the Locale preferences is now wide enough to show the full languagenames (Bug #109)
Added updated Keymap->Language database to the Keymap preferences (Bug #108)
Keymap preferences can now handle a larger number of language codes, per keymap (Bug #111)

* February 19, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Moved /atheos/autolnk/ to /usr/indexes/.

* February 18, 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Removed the atheos subdirectory to simplify and flatten the filesystem hierarchy.
Moved /system/libs/ to /system/libraries/.
Note that you have to adapt your GrUB menu.lst file when upgrading.

* February 18, 2007, Flemming H. SÃ¸rensen *

New Keyboard pref.

* February 17, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The VGA_MISC_OUT_W and VGA_MISC_OUT_R registers were swapped in the Savage driver,
leading to incorrect hardware configuration and flcikering displays in some cases.
Patch from Tim ter Laak <timl@scintilla.utwente.nl>

* February 13, 2007, Flemming H. SÃ¸rensen *

Localized the Printers preferences.

* February 8, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fix pthread_exit() and pthread_join() in libpthread
	o Pass the value in value_ptr to exit_thread() in pthread_exit()
	o Retrieve the value from wait_for_thread() and set value_ptr in pthread_join()
	o Use our own entry function for spawn_thread() in pthread_create() and call
	  pthread_exit() with the return value when the thread entry function returns

* January 29, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixed a serious bug with the Savage driver that affected Savage 4 and Savage 2000 series
cards (and may have caused other us-seen bugs). The framebuffer and registers are now
mapped correctly for the correct type of chipset.

* January 27 2007, Kaj de Vos *

Moved /atheos/sys/ to /atheos/system/. It has been sticking out like a sore thumb
for a long time. Now we can treat the system and an image area the same during
building and installing. Builder now provides an $IMAGE environment variable that
points to the chosen installation area, to replace $DIST_DIR.

* January 22, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added an additional PCI ID for the Intel Pro/100 VE to the eepro100 driver.
Patch from Turki Al-Marri <turki.almarri@gmail.com>

* January 20, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated the nVidia NIC (forcedeth) driver to version 0.48 (Synced with the Linux
driver). The driver adds support for newer chips including the CK804, MCP04, MCP51
and MCP55, Gigabit speeds and bug fixes.

Thanks to Stephan Wiebusch <stephanwib@googlemail.com> for testing and debugging.

* January 19, 2007, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fix the declaration of PROMPT_COMMAND on bash 3.2 (Bug #60)

* January 17, 2007, Flemming SÃ¸rensen *

ColdFish, MediaPlayer, MediaConverter and Media Pref. will now tell the user
if they can't contact the media server.
ColdFish and MediaPlayer PNGs has been moved to the sub-folder "images/".

* December 20, 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixed the screen-mode list enumaration in the Vesa driver SetScreenMode(), and
also fixed the alignment of objects in off-screen video memory on the Savage
driver. Both patches fix issues with certain Savage video cards, and both patches
are from Tim ter Laak <timl@scintilla.utwente.nl>

* December 9, 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Moved the wallpapers to /system/resources/wallpapers instead of having copies in
every users home directory. The Desktop Preferences has been modifed to match.

* December 8 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The registrar scans file extensions backwards to avoid "double extensions". Patch
from Anthony Morphett, fixes bug #23 

* December 8 2006, Flemming SÃ¸rensen *

Added a patch from "computrius", that will let ColdFish load a dir. full of audio,
instead of just a number of selected files.

* December 4 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Introduced a "package" command, written in Orca. pkgmanager is now deprecated, but
as long as it's still there, they're based on the same library, written in Orca.
In the future, Builder will also use this library, Packager will get package
installation features, and pkgmanager will be removed.

* November 18 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Put the auto build "nightly" build scripts in CVS under build-tools/scripts/auto-build

* November 15 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Overhauled the SCSI bus manager.  The code has been split down and modulerised,
and a lot of the ATAPI code has been imported to improve error handling and
clean up a lot of the direct command manipulation code.  SCSI CD-ROM drives
are now supported; by extension, USB CD-ROM drives work.  The CD-ROM device
supports reading, CD-DA and packet command (Used by cdrecord), but no analogue
audio playback functions have been implemented.

---- 0.6.2 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* October 31 2006, Flemming SÃ¸rensen *

Fixing the MediaPlayer Makefile, so the Category is written after the catalogs is added.
Dock will now handle the "Other" category correctly.

* October 30 2006, Flemming SÃ¸rensen *

Added more Russian translations.

* October 29 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Corrected and improved the Dutch translations.

* October 28 2006, Flemming SÃ¸rensen *

Merged localization patches, and new translations collected from several contributors.
Replaced the Danish keymap.

* October 23 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Patched drive probing in the ata_pci driver for certain drives that set the ATA
count register to 0x01 during the probe.  This has been observed on certain drives
from NEC and Toshiba, and possibly others.

* October 23 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated the OSS drivers to work with the OSS driver in the new audio framework,
and fixed the mixer ioctl() so it doesn't return -EINVAL any more.

* October 21 2006, Kaj de Vos *

AtheOS seems to have had a modified xterm terminfo entry. The standard NCurses one
hardly works with ATerm. The AtheOS definition doesn't provide all features anymore
for the current ATerm, either. The NCurses rxvt-16color definition turns out to work
best, so I made that default. However, unlike the original AtheOS xterm, it doesn't
map box drawing characters to the right font glyphs - unless something else is wrong
with the font rendering.

Also, the delete key still doesn't work in the terminal - another regression from
AtheOS.

* October 18 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added SDL_mixer, SDL_net, SDL_image and SDL_sound to the base distribution, but only
got SDL_net to build a shared library so far.

* October 17 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Merged localization patches from BurningShadow and new translations that he collected
from several contributors.

* October 15 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Moved the template and root users home directory into a Builder resource.  Removed
the old template stuff from CVS.
Only the template directory and root users home directory are created.
Removed the default guest user account from the default passwd file.
Fixed the mkhome script to copy the .profile file when a new home directory is created.

* October 4 2006, Arno Klenke *

Added usb_hid / usbkeyboard drivers

* September 27 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Moved fonts to ports to have modular packages. Added several new ones.
Added FreeFont to compensate for the CodeAlt font that we had to drop some time ago.
Updated our ancient original URW GhostScript fonts to the latest ones, from Gnome
Russia and Mandriva, so we support Cyrillic again.
Replaced Bitstream Vera fonts with their successor, the Deja Vu fonts, and made them
the default fonts. Unfortunately, ABrowse can't handle Deja Vu and FreeFont. When
that's fixed, we can drop Vera.
We have box drawing glyphs in our Mono fonts now, but the terminal doesn't seem to
find them yet. They're boxy, but they're good, so we should find a fix for this. It
worked in AtheOS times.
Dropped the SyllableConsole font. No NIH syndrome here.

* September 22 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added more keymaps, by BurningShadow. (How come these keymap makers all go by
false names?)
Normalized keymap names.

* September 14 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added the latest keymaps from Maritimus' keymaps pack 2.5, in source form.
Deleted the previous binary versions.
Please let us know if older keymaps were better.

* September 14 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added SDL to the base system.

* September 9 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Completed the rewrite of PkgManager in Orca. It is smaller, cleaner and more correct.
There is some code in there to account for oddities in the symlink structures created
by the old C++ PkgManager, but some quirks can still occur when upgrading.

* September 3 2006, Arno Klenke *

Fixed intel graphics driver

* August 9 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Finished the normalization move of GLibC from /usr/glibc2/ to /usr/glibc/.

* July 25 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Finally got NCurses to install the TermInfo database in a staging area during system
building. It moved from /usr/share/terminfo to usr/ncurses/share/terminfo. We'll have
to see if this is a good place for it.

* July 10 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added a parallel printer (lp_printer) driver, based on the Linux driver and ported
by Lengyel Sandor <slengyel@chello.hu>

* June 19 2006, Arno Klenke *

The ata busmanager is now more flexible to support non-standard ata hostcontroller drivers

* June 4 2006, Arno Klenke *

GCC4 fixes

* May 25 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Combined updates from Jan L. Hauffa and Arno Klenke

	o Improved conditionals handling
	o Mutex handling is more compliant
	o pthread_cleanup_push(), pthread_cleanup_pop() implemented & the cleanup
	  handlers are called from pthread_exit()
	o Basic pthread_join() implementation

---- 0.6.1 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* May 14 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Some Maestro bug fixes:
	o Don't return IRQRET_BREAK from the IRQ handler
	o Return usable data from SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE ioctl
	o Page align the DMA buffer so we don't get Bad Noise during playback (This
	  seems to be a habit of mine)

* May 5 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added binary keymaps from Maritimus. Some of them will still be overwritten by those
that have text versions in the repository, until all issues are sorted out.

				Known issues:
	o	French and Belgian: deadkeys don't respect the shift lock.
	o	Breton and Cherokee: multicharacter keys don't work.
	o	Canadian Multilingual, German 453, Swedish SS-66-22-41: Group key won't work.
	o	Complex scripts and BIDI don't work yet.
	o	CTRL+Shift keys ignored.

				Likely issues:
	o	Portuguese Brazilian: 103rd key, keymap dot, probably won't work: please report.

				Other:
	o	Romanian keymaps allocate S & T with comma instead of S & T with cedilla:
		use the cedilla deadkey for legacy situations.
	o	You will need fonts able to handle the characters for them to display:
		Install your fonts to atheos/sys/fonts/ .

* May 3 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added newer versions of the URW fonts, from Maritimus.
Updated Danish, Icelandic and Faroese keymaps, from Flemming Sørensen.

* May 1 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Fixed memory detection on Radeon IGP cards
PCI busmanager correctly handles multifunction devices (Patch by Arno Klenke)
Enable the off-screen bitmaps support in the Savage driver now that they work, thanks
to a related appserver fix from Arno.

* April 10 2006, Arno Klenke *

Synced geforcefx driver with X driver.
Added the updated screen preferences

* March 25 2006, Arno Klenke *

The geforcefx driver should now work on cards which store their real pci device ids
in a special register.

* March 16 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Updated the Savage driver
	o Support "old" streams engine (overlays)
	o Fix overlays in 16bit mode with "new" streams
	o Support for off-screen bitmaps based on an early X.org EXA patch.  This is
	  currently disabled as I can not solve a rendering error in 16bit modes with
	  off-screen->screen blits.  Asyncronous rendering is enabled however.

* February 24 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added a Maestro 1/2[E] driver.  Ported from the Linux 2.6 OSS driver and tested
on a Maestro 2E.  PCM output and mixer are functional.

* February 11 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Added objcopy from BinUtils to the base distribution, because it's needed by rescopy.

* January 27 2006, Arno Klenke *

Synced the geforcefx driver with the X driver. This will hopefully fix the FX5200 problems.

* January 26 2006, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added a USB printer driver.  The driver is a re-write of the Linux usblp driver
and has been tested with an EPSON Stylus Color 900 with CUPS and the Gutenprint
raster driver.

* January 25 2006, Kaj de Vos *

Rearranged the system initialization scripts.
Introduced an early-init directory for packages, to allow scripts to run before
user login, specifically to allow setting variables in the user's environment.
Introduced user-early-init.sh.
Renamed net_init.sh and user_init.sh to network-init.sh and user-init.sh, for
consistency and more natural writing.

Support for acpi irq routing in the PCI busmanager

---- 0.6.0a Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* December 26 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixed both mkhome & Users & Groups preferences to work correctly together.  mkhome
now accepts two arguments; the new home directory to create and the username of
the owner.  Users & Groups has been changed to path these arguments.

* December 19 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Over the course of the last week, made a lot of fixes for Syllable 0.6.0a.

* September 2 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

It was brought to my attention that the code_alt.ttf font which was being shipped
with Syllable was a commercial shareware font that should not be redistributed.
The font has been removed from Syllable.

* September 2 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Small patch to the ATA driver so it uses a counting semaphore instead of a counter
and a loop that snooze()s while it wait.  This should reduce CPU usage and reduce
latency for commands.

---- 0.5.7 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* August 19 2005, Arno Klenke *

Changed linker flags in the decorator makefiles to fix freezes

* August 15 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

New Savage driver that supports all S3 Savage chipsets (Although not the mis-named
Via Unichrome "ProSavage" chips)  The driver has been tested on an IX-MV Mobile
Savage and supports acclerated 2D ops.  Video Overlays are only currently supported
on the Mobile Savage chips (IX & MX) pending demand for support on older chipsets.

* August 14 2005, Arno Klenke *

Appserver changes:
	- Make it work with gcc 3.4 and the new glibc
	- Line drawing with DM_BLEND
	- Improved sprite code

Fixed aperture detection for i830 and i845 chipsets

* June 1 2005, Arno Klenke *

Set AC97_NR in the i810 audio driver to 1. This is reported to fix problems with some
chipsets.

* May 30 2005, Arno Klenke *

Fixed interrupt handling in the rtl8139 network driver.

* May 18 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Enabled the min/max macros in macros.h for userland C code. They were restricted to
kernel space due to clashing with the C++ standard library, but some C applications
use them.

* May 12 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Generalized the makefiles more. Removed generic hardwired optimization and debug options.
Changed more occurrences of $(CC) to $(CXX). Some rules probably still need to be
differentiated between C and C++.

From now on, please don't hardwire optimization options that aren't specific to your code.
Consult Builder/settings to see which options are used by default globally.

* May 8 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Added Frisian flag to locale preference applet. Enabled several more flags we already had,
except for Russian because it doesn't seem to be the right one. Corrected spelling of
some languages.

---- 0.5.6 Released -------------------------------------------------------------------

* April 10 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

New Icelandic keymap and updated Danish and Faeroese keymaps from BurningShadow

* March 26 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Fixed the installer, which was completely broken due to invalid hardcoded paths.
Obviously, it still hardly has any error checking, or it wouldn't have worked at all.
Also made it handle partitions with unrecognized types, which weren't presented in the
user interface, although it was able to install onto them.

* March 25 2005, Jake Hamby *

Updated libpthread with a simple implementation of pthread_kill().

Moved the system call table into a new header file, <atheos/syscalltable.h>,
so that both the kernel and the strace utility can include it.

* March 24 2005, Henrik Isaksson *

Added warpspeed to decorators Makefile.

* March 19 2005, Arno Klenke *

Fixed possible data corruptions in the atapi driver

* March 9 2005, Henrik Isaksson *

Changed makefile.rules; CPPFLAGS -> CXXFLAGS

* March 1 2005, Arno Klenke *

Updated sis3xx driver

* February 27 2005, Kaj de Vos *

Sanitized some aspects of the makefiles. Fixed bugs and parameterized hardcoded tool calls
to allow compilation with GCC 3.4 and with cross-compilers. From now on, please keep in
mind that compilation can be relative to a staging area instead of the running system
(managed by Builder). Use
	$(CC)
	$(CXX)
	$(AS)
	$(LD)
instead of
	gcc
	g++
	as
	ld
to allow cross-compilation. Use
	$(CXX)
instead of
	gcc -lstdc++
to allow compilation with GCC 3.4.x.

Changed occurrences of O4 to O3. Higher than O3 doesn't exist as an optimization option
for GCC. Replaced a lot of occurrences of CPPLAGS with CXXFLAGS. CPPFLAGS is for the
preprocesser, not for C++. This probably means that the media framework was never optimized.

* February 5 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added libdl, which is a simple wrapper around Syllable native functionality and provides
a POSIX dlfcn API.
Cleaned up the libpthread Makefile and bumped the library version to 1 to handle libc ABI
breakage.

* January 29 2005, Jake Hamby *

Removed binary keymap files from CVS and replaced them with their ASCII
equivalents.  Cleared the NumLock flag on all keymaps.  Updated Makefile
to convert keymaps into binary during "make dist".

* January 29 2005, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Added a National Semiconductor DP8381x based NIC driver, ported from Linux 2.6 (natsemi.c)
The driver is suitable for dp83810, dp83815 and dp83816 based NICs E.g. the Netgear FA311
and FA312.  The driver was tested on a Netgear FA311 (dp83816).

* January 10 2005, Kaj de Vos

Over the past days, pulled several more parts from the current distribution into the
repository. Several went into a new resources facility that I implemented in Builder.

User documentation was in the repository, but was not being installed by the Makefiles.
Moved it to Builder/resources, also.

* January 6 2005, Kaj de Vos

Updated default AppServer configuration. The currently distributed configuration
wasn't in the repository.

SiS 900 and nVidia "nForce" NIC drivers from from Michael Krueger <invenies@web.de>.
The SiS driver is considered experimental due to lack of positive testing.  The nVidia
driver is a port of the Linux forcedeth driver, which was written from a reverse engineering
effort of the nVidia binary drivers.

* October 30th 2004, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Removed the S3 Savage IX/MX driver.  This driver was buggy and largly non-functional.
S3 Savage IX/MX cards will work with the Vesa 2.0 driver.

ATerm.  Also cleaned up user_init.sh (Drives can be mounted by the new Desktop)
and also call /Applications/Preferences/Network instead of the old netprefs binary
to detect network changes.

* September 5th 2004, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

3Dfx Voodoo 3/4/5 driver from Jan Hauffa <hauffa@in.tum.de>  The driver supports
full 2D acceleration and video overlays on all Voodoo 3, 4 and 5 boards.

* May 13 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

- Swedish keymap:
  Added a couple of deadkeys for east European languages (ÄŒÄŽÄšÅ‡Å˜Å Å¤Å®Å½).
  The new characters are available through the Â´ key (next to backspace), when AltGr
  is pressed.

* May 5 2004, Henrik Isaksson *

- Added ATERM_ATTR=0x80 to setup_environ.sh to get rid of that awful cyan background
  colour, often seen on screen shots... .o)
- Added "0.5.3 Released" to all changelogs at appropriate locations. Should make a bit
  easier to see what has been done since the last release...

* May 2 2004, Kaj de Vos *

Spring cleaning. Now that Syllable 0.5.3 is out, I deleted most remaining
third-party sources. In most cases we're now using newer versions, or the version
in CVS didn't work anyway. In any case, they're not built from CVS anymore, but
installed from the original tarballs by Builder.
  Freetype
  NCurses
  ZLib
  Bash
  BZip2
  FindUtils
  GZip
For historical reference, some packages that have patches remain.

First check-in of the new build system.
Recipes for third-party software packages will follow,
and also tweaking to many native packages to make them comply.

Removed sed 4.0.7 because it didn't build after going through CVS.

Patch from William Rose <wrose@zip-it.org> which adds an appserver= argument to the
kernel command line, which allows the user to specify the path to the appserver binary
to load.  Useful for development/testing.

* Aug 14 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Backed out the earlier patch the nVidia driver (Aug 7, 2003).  nvidia.cpp reverted to

More Matrox driver changes.
	* Split off the DAC control code from the rest of the CRTC code
	* Support for older Matrox cards with Texas Instruments TVP3026 DACs
	* Bug fixes for the Millenium I
	* The driver does not export 15bit or very-high resolution video modes
	  for TVP3026 DACs

Hardware cursor code has been disabled and the driver has been "hardwired" to
never use Vesa mode-switching, which means it can detect but not work with newer
Matrox cards (E.g. the Gx50 & Parhalea cards)

* Jul 14 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Fixes to the nVidia, Mach64 & SiS3xx video drivers from Arno Klenke <arno_klenke@yahoo.de>
From Arno "There was a bug in the videooverlay code of all these drivers which caused screen
corruptions while the overlay was active. I have also added the newest XFree driver code to
the sis driver and vesa mode switching for notebook chipsets to the mach driver."

* Jul 5 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

A whole bunch of changes to the Matrox driver as part of an attempt to cleanup &
improve the driver.

* Jun 29 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

makefiles, as the new build system will take care of this.

* June 10 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

Put the Icon Translator back into the base distribution.

* June 9 2003, Kaj de Vos *

Imported ncurses 5.3.
Removed man, groff and diffutils.
Removed sed 3.02 after importing 4.0.7 a while ago.

* May 22 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Fixed a bug in CodeView, concerning backspace at the beginning of a line. (It did not
delete the newline character on the line above, but instead the first character of the
line above.)

* May 17 2003, Kristian Van Der Vliet *

The BIOS and ATA drivers now check for kernel parameters that indicate which drives and
controllers to enable.  For the BIOS driver:

o By default, the driver only probes for floppy drives and ignores all harddrives
o Individual drives can be enabled by passing hd?=bios in the kernel parameters E.g.
   hda=bios enables the BIOS driver for hda
 
For the ATA driver:

o By default the driver probes for a Primary and a Secondary controller but no others.
o The primary controller can be disabled by passing ata0=disabled in the kernel paramters.
  The secondary controller can be disabled by passing ata1=disabled.

The BIOS & ATA paramters can be combined.  E.g. if you wish to disable the ATA controller
for hda and hdb and instead use the BIOS driver, while leaving the drive cdc enabled in
the ATA driver you would pass:

ata0=disabled hda=bios hdb=bios

* May 11 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Checked in CodeView class.

* Apr 27 2003, Henrik Isaksson *

Updated keymaps for the new keymap format.
