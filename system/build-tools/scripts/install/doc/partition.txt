Syllable requires a single hard disk partition, which must be formatted with the
AtheOS File System.  The following step allows you to partition your hard drive
for Syllable.  The step after that will allow you to format the partition.

If the partition for Syllable already exists, just press the "n" key in response
to the following question, and you will proceed directly to the formatting
stage.

WARNING: Partitioning a drive which already contains data may destroy
the contents of that drive!  Ensure that you have backed up any data that
you wish to keep before you proceed to partition and format your hard drive.
