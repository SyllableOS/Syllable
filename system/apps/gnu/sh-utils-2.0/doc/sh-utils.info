Introduction
************

   First of all, this manual is incomplete.  The `stty' section, in
particular, needs substantial reorganization and additional explanatory
text before it will be up to the standard of other GNU manuals.
Explanatory text in general is lacking; the manual presently assumes you
pretty much know what to do, and just need to be reminded of how.  Thus,
if you are interested, please get involved in improving this manual.
The entire GNU community will benefit.

   Some of these programs are useful only when writing shell scripts;
utilities like these are, in fact, the "language" of shell scripts (to
a great extent).  Others are occasionally useful interactively.

   The GNU shell utilities are mostly compatible with the POSIX.2
standard.

   Please report bugs to `bug-sh-utils@gnu.org'.  Remember to include
the version number, machine architecture, input files, and any other
information needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but please
include a description of the problem as well, since this is sometimes
difficult to infer. *Note Bugs: (gcc)Bugs.

   This manual was originally derived from the Unix man pages in the
distribution, which were written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim
Meyering.  What you are reading now is the authoritative documentation
for these utilities;  the man pages are no longer being maintained.
Franc,ois Pinard did the initial conversion to Texinfo format.  Karl
Berry did the indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results.
Richard Stallman contributed his usual invaluable insights to the
overall process.

Common options
**************

   Certain options are available in all these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

   Many of these programs take arbitrary strings as arguments.  In those
cases, `--help' and `--version' are taken as these options only if
there is one and exactly one command line argument.

`--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

`--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

Date input formats
******************

   First, a quote:

     Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months,
     are so complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make
     coherent mental reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had
     some tyrannical god contrived to enslave our minds to time, to
     make it all but impossible for us to escape subjection to sodden
     routines and unpleasant surprises, he could hardly have done
     better than handing down our present system.  It is like a set of
     trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
     surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands
     ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
     circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language
     and science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
     level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
     persistently encourages our terror of time.

     ...  It is as though architects had to measure length in feet,
     width in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction
     manuals demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is
     no wonder then that we often look into our own immediate past or
     future, last Tuesday or a week from Sunday, with feelings of
     helpless confusion.  ...

     -- Robert Grudin, `Time and the Art of Living'.

   This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept.  These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs.  The C interface (via the `getdate'
function) is not described here.

   Although the date syntax here can represent any possible time since
zero A.D., computer integers are not big enough for such a
(comparatively) long time.  The earliest date semantically allowed on
Unix systems is midnight, 1 January 1970 UCT.

General date syntax
===================

   A "date" is a string, possibly empty, containing many items
separated by whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no
ambiguity arises.  The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e.,
midnight).  Order of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain
many flavors of items:

   * calendar date items

   * time of the day items

   * time zone items

   * day of the week items

   * relative items

   * pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

   A few numbers may be written out in words in most contexts.  This is
most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items (see
below).  Here is the list: `first' for 1, `next' for 2, `third' for 3,
`fourth' for 4, `fifth' for 5, `sixth' for 6, `seventh' for 7, `eighth'
for 8, `ninth' for 9, `tenth' for 10, `eleventh' for 11 and `twelfth'
for 12.  Also, `last' means exactly -1.

   When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be
written numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes
the allowed strings.

   Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored.  Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Calendar date item,  Next: Time of day item,  Prev: General date syntax,  Up: Date input formats

Calendar date item
==================

   A "calendar date item" specifies a day of the year.  It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

     1970-09-17           # ISO 8601.
     70-9-17              # This century assumed by default.
     70-09-17             # Leading zeros are ignored.
     9/17/72              # Common U.S. writing.
     24 September 1972
     24 Sept 72           # September has a special abbreviation.
     24 Sep 72            # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
     Sep 24, 1972
     24-sep-72
     24sep72

   The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year
is used, or the current year if none.  For example:

     9/17
     sep 17

   Here are the rules.

   For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY' is allowed,
where YEAR is any positive number, MONTH is a number between 01 and 12,
and DAY is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If YEAR is less than 100, then 1900 is
added to it to force a date in this century.  The construct
`MONTH/DAY/YEAR', popular in the United States, is accepted.  Also
`MONTH/DAY', omitting the year.

   Literal months may be spelled out in full: `January', `February',
`March', `April', `May', `June', `July', `August', `September',
`October', `November' or `December'.  Literal months may be abbreviated
to their first three letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.
It is also permitted to write `Sept' instead of `September'.

   When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as
any of the following:

     DAY MONTH YEAR
     DAY MONTH
     MONTH DAY YEAR
     DAY-MONTH-YEAR

   Or, omitting the year:

     MONTH DAY


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Time of day item,  Next: Time zone item,  Prev: Calendar date item,  Up: Date input formats

Time of day item
================

   A "time of day item" in date strings specifies the time on a given
day.  Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

     20:02:0
     20:02
     8:02pm
     20:02-0500      # In EST (Eastern U.S. Standard Time).

   More generally, the time of the day may be given as
`HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND', where HOUR is a number between 0 and 23, MINUTE
is a number between 0 and 59, and SECOND is a number between 0 and 59.
Alternatively, `:SECOND' can be omitted, in which case it is taken to
be zero.

   If the time is followed by `am' or `pm' (or `a.m.' or `p.m.'), HOUR
is restricted to run from 1 to 12, and `:MINUTE' may be omitted (taken
to be zero).  `am' indicates the first half of the day, `pm' indicates
the second half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of
1: midnight is `12am' while noon is `12pm'.

   The time may alternatively be followed by a time zone correction,
expressed as `SHHMM', where S is `+' or `-', HH is a number of zone
hours and MM is a number of zone minutes.  When a time zone correction
is given this way, it forces interpretation of the time relative to
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), overriding any previous specification
for the time zone or the local time zone.  The MINUTE part of the time
of the day may not be elided when a time zone correction is used.  This
is the only way to specify a time zone correction by fractional parts
of an hour.

   Either `am'/`pm' or a time zone correction may be specified, but not
both.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Time zone item,  Next: Day of week item,  Prev: Time of day item,  Up: Date input formats

Time zone item
==============

   A "time zone item" specifies an international time zone, indicated by
a small set of letters.  They are supported for backward compatibility
reasons, but they are not recommended because they are ambiguous in
practice: for example, the abbreviation `EST' has different meanings in
Australia and the United States.  Any included period is ignored.
Military time zone designations use a single letter.  Currently, only
integral zone hours may be represented in a time zone item.  See the
previous section for a finer control over the time zone correction.

   Here are many non-daylight-saving-time time zones, indexed by the
zone hour value.

Day of week item
================

   The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date
(only if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

   Days of the week may be spelled out in full: `Sunday', `Monday',
`Tuesday', `Wednesday', `Thursday', `Friday' or `Saturday'.  Days may
be abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
period.  The special abbreviations `Tues' for `Tuesday', `Wednes' for
`Wednesday' and `Thur' or `Thurs' for `Thursday' are also allowed.

   A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like `third
monday'.  In this context, `last DAY' or `next DAY' is also acceptable;
they move one week before or after the day that DAY by itself would
represent.

   A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Relative item in date strings,  Next: Pure numbers in date strings,  Prev: Day of week item,  Up: Date input formats

Relative item in date strings
=============================

   "Relative items" adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

     1 year
     1 year ago
     3 years
     2 days

   The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string `year'
or `month' for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy units,
as years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise units
are `fortnight' which is worth 14 days, `week' worth 7 days, `day'
worth 24 hours, `hour' worth 60 minutes, `minute' or `min' worth 60
seconds, and `second' or `sec' worth one second.  An `s' suffix on
these units is accepted and ignored.

   The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an
optionally signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively
signed.  No number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a
relative item by the string `ago' is equivalent to preceding the unit
by a multiplicator with value -1.

   The string `tomorrow' is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
`day'), the string `yesterday' is worth one day in the past (equivalent
to `day ago').

   The strings `now' or `today' are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise change by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in `12:00 today'.  The string `this' also has the meaning
of a zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings
like `this thursday'.

   When a relative item makes the resulting date to cross the boundary
between DST and non-DST (or vice-versa), the hour is adjusted according
to the local time.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Pure numbers in date strings,  Next: Authors of getdate,  Prev: Relative item in date strings,  Up: Date input formats

Pure numbers in date strings
============================

   The precise intepretation of a pure decimal number is dependent of
the context in the date string.

   If the decimal number is of the form YYYYMMDD and no other calendar
date item (*note Calendar date item::) appears before it in the date
string, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as
the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

   If the decimal number is of the form HHMM and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then HH is read as the hour
of the day and MM as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
the day.  MM can also be omitted.

   If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a
number in the date string, but no relative item, then the number
overrides the year.

Authors of `getdate'
====================

   `getdate' was originally implemented by Steven M. Bellovin
(<smb@research.att.com>) while at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.  The code was later tweaked by a couple of people on
Usenet, then completely overhauled by Rich $alz (<rsalz@bbn.com>) and
Jim Berets (<jberets@bbn.com>) in August, 1990.  Various revisions for
the GNU system were made by David MacKenzie, Jim Meyering, and others.

   This chapter was originally produced by Franc,ois Pinard
(<pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>) from the `getdate.y' source code, and then
edited by K. Berry (<kb@cs.umb.edu>).

`echo': Print a line of text
============================

   `echo' writes each given STRING to standard output, with a space
between each and a newline after the last one.  Synopsis:

     echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-n'
     Do not output the trailing newline.

`-e'
     Enable interpretation of the following backslash-escaped
     characters in each STRING:

    `\a'
          alert (bell)

    `\b'
          backspace

    `\c'
          suppress trailing newline

    `\f'
          form feed

    `\n'
          new line

    `\r'
          carriage return

    `\t'
          horizontal tab

    `\v'
          vertical tab

    `\\'
          backslash

    `\NNN'
          the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal); if NNN is not
          a valid octal number, it is printed literally.

`printf': Format and print data
===============================

   `printf' does formatted printing of text. Synopsis:

     printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...

   `printf' prints the FORMAT string, interpreting `%' directives and
`\' escapes in the same way as the C `printf' function.  The FORMAT
argument is re-used as necessary to convert all of the given ARGUMENTs.

   `printf' has one additional directive, `%b', which prints its
argument string with `\' escapes interpreted in the same way as in the
FORMAT string.

   `printf' interprets `\0ooo' in FORMAT as an octal number (if OOO is
0 to 3 octal digits) specifying a character to print, and `\xhhh' as a
hexadecimal number (if HHH is 1 to 3 hex digits) specifying a character
to print.

   An additional escape, `\c', causes `printf' to produce no further
output.

   The only options are a lone `--help' or `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: yes invocation,  Prev: printf invocation,  Up: Printing text

`yes': Print a string until interrupted
=======================================

   `yes' prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces and
followed by a newline, forever until it is killed.  If no arguments are
given, it prints `y' followed by a newline forever until killed.

   The only options are a lone `--help' or `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

**********

   This section describes commands that are primarily useful for their
exit status, rather than their output.  Thus, they are often used as the
condition of shell `if' statements, or as the last command in a
pipeline.

* Menu:

* false invocation::            Do nothing, unsuccessfully.
* true invocation::             Do nothing, successfully.
* test invocation::             Check file types and compare values.
* expr invocation::             Evaluate expressions.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: false invocation,  Next: true invocation,  Up: Conditions

`false': Do nothing, unsuccessfully
===================================

   `false' does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning
"failure".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
unsuccessful command is needed.

   `false' ignores _all_ command line arguments, even `--help' and
`--version', since to do otherwise would change expected behavior that
some programmers may be relying on.

   This version of `false' is implemented as a C program, and is thus
more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may
safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: true invocation,  Next: test invocation,  Prev: false invocation,  Up: Conditions

`true': Do nothing, successfully
================================

   `true' does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
"success".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:'
(colon) does the same thing faster.

   `true' ignores _all_ command line arguments, even `--help' and
`--version', since to do otherwise would change expected behavior that
some programmers may be relying on.

   This version of `true' is implemented as a C program, and is thus
more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may
safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: test invocation,  Next: expr invocation,  Prev: true invocation,  Up: Conditions

`test': Check file types and compare values
===========================================

   `test' returns a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression EXPR.  Each part of the
expression must be a separate argument.

   `test' has file status checks, string operators, and numeric
comparison operators.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   Besides the options below, `test' accepts a lone `--help' or
`--version'.  *Note Common options::.  A single non-option argument is
also allowed: `test' returns true if the argument is not null.

* Menu:

* File type tests::             -[bcdfhLpSt]
* Access permission tests::     -[gkruwxOG]
* File characteristics tests::  -e -s -nt -ot -ef

   These options test for particular types of files.  (Everything's a
file, but not all files are the same!)

`-b FILE'
     True if FILE exists and is a block special device.

`-c FILE'
     True if FILE exists and is a character special device.

`-d FILE'

     True if FILE exists and has its set-group-id bit set.

`-k FILE'
     True if FILE has its "sticky" bit set.

`-r FILE'
     True if FILE exists and is readable.

`-u FILE'
     True if FILE exists and has its set-user-id bit set.

`-w FILE'
     True if FILE exists and is writable.

File: sh-utils.info,  Node: File characteristics tests,  Next: String tests,  Prev: Access permission tests,  Up: test invocation

File characteristics tests
--------------------------

   These options test other file characteristics.

`-e FILE'
     True if FILE exists.

`-s FILE'
     True if FILE exists and has a size greater than zero.

`FILE1 -nt FILE2'
     True if FILE1 is newer (according to modification date) than FILE2.

`FILE1 -ot FILE2'
     True if FILE1 is older (according to modification date) than FILE2.

`FILE1 -ef FILE2'
     True if FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers,
     i.e., if they are hard links to each other.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: String tests,  Next: Numeric tests,  Prev: File characteristics tests,  Up: test invocation

String tests
------------

   These options test string characteristics.  Strings are not quoted
for `test', though you may need to quote them to protect characters
with special meaning to the shell, e.g., spaces.

`-z STRING'
     True if the length of STRING is zero.

`-n STRING'
`STRING'
     True if the length of STRING is nonzero.

`STRING1 = STRING2'
     True if the strings are equal.

`STRING1 != STRING2'
     True if the strings are not equal.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Numeric tests,  Next: Connectives for test,  Prev: String tests,  Up: test invocation

Numeric tests
-------------

   Numeric relationals.  The arguments must be entirely numeric
(possibly negative), or the special expression `-l STRING', which
evaluates to the length of STRING.

`ARG1 -eq ARG2'
`ARG1 -ne ARG2'
`ARG1 -lt ARG2'
`ARG1 -le ARG2'
`ARG1 -gt ARG2'
`ARG1 -ge ARG2'
     These arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal,
     not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or
     greater-than-or-equal than ARG2, respectively.

   For example:

     test -1 -gt -2 && echo yes
     => yes
     test -l abc -gt 1 && echo yes
     => yes
     test 0x100 -eq 1
     error--> test: integer expression expected before -eq


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Connectives for test,  Prev: Numeric tests,  Up: test invocation

Connectives for `test'
----------------------

   The usual logical connectives.

`! EXPR'
     True if EXPR is false.

`EXPR1 -a EXPR2'
     True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true.

`EXPR1 -o EXPR2'
     True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: expr invocation,  Prev: test invocation,  Up: Conditions

`expr': Evaluate expressions
============================

   `expr' evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard
output.  Each token of the expression must be a separate argument.

   Operands are either numbers or strings.  `expr' coerces anything
appearing in an operand position to an integer or a string depending on
the operation being applied to it.

   Strings are not quoted for `expr' itself, though you may need to
quote them to protect characters with special meaning to the shell,
e.g., spaces.

   Operators may given as infix symbols or prefix keywords.  Parentheses
may be used for grouping in the usual manner (you must quote parentheses
to avoid the shell evaluating them, however).

   Exit status:

     0 if the expression is neither null nor 0,
     1 if the expression is null or 0,
     2 for invalid expressions.

* Menu:

* String expressions::          <colon> match substr index length quote
* Numeric expressions::         + - * / %
* Relations for expr::          | & < <= = == != >= >
* Examples of expr::            Examples.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: String expressions,  Next: Numeric expressions,  Up: expr invocation

String expressions
------------------

   `expr' supports pattern matching and other string operators.  These
have lower precedence than both the numeric and relational operators (in
the next sections).

`STRING : REGEX'
     Perform pattern matching.  The arguments are coerced to strings
     and the second is considered to be a (basic, a la GNU `grep')
     regular expression, with a `^' implicitly prepended.  The first
     argument is then matched against this regular expression.

     If the match succeeds and REGEX uses `\(' and `\)', the `:'
     expression returns the part of STRING that matched the
     subexpression; otherwise, it returns the number of characters
     matched.

     If the match fails, the `:' operator returns the null string if
     `\(' and `\)' are used in REGEX, otherwise 0.

     Only the first `\( ... \)' pair is relevant to the return value;
     additional pairs are meaningful only for grouping the regular
     expression operators.

     In the regular expression, `\+', `\?', and `\|' are operators
     which respectively match one or more, zero or one, or separate
     alternatives.  SunOS and other `expr''s treat these as regular
     characters.  (POSIX allows either behavior.)  *Note Regular
     Expression Library: (regex)Top, for details of regular expression
     syntax.  Some examples are in *Note Examples of expr::.

`match STRING REGEX'
     An alternative way to do pattern matching.  This is the same as
     `STRING : REGEX'.

`substr STRING POSITION LENGTH'
     Returns the substring of STRING beginning at POSITION with length
     at most LENGTH.  If either POSITION or LENGTH is negative, zero,
     or non-numeric, returns the null string.

`index STRING CHARSET'
     Returns the first position in STRING where the first character in
     CHARSET was found.  If no character in CHARSET is found in STRING,
     return 0.

`length STRING'
     Returns the length of STRING.

`quote TOKEN'
     Interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a keyword like MATCH or
     an operator like `/'.  This makes it possible to test `expr length
     quote "$x"' or `expr quote "$x" : '.*/\(.\)'' and have it do the
     right thing even if the value of $X happens to be (for example)
     `/' or `index'.  This operator is a GNU extension.  It is disabled
     when the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is set.

   To make `expr' interpret keywords as strings, you must use the
`quote' operator.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Numeric expressions,  Next: Relations for expr,  Prev: String expressions,  Up: expr invocation

Numeric expressions
-------------------

   `expr' supports the usual numeric operators, in order of increasing
precedence.  The string operators (previous section) have lower
precedence, the connectives (next section) have higher.

`+ -'
     Addition and subtraction.  Both arguments are coerced to numbers;
     an error occurs if this cannot be done.

`* / %'
     Multiplication, division, remainder.  Both arguments are coerced to
     numbers; an error occurs if this cannot be done.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Relations for expr,  Next: Examples of expr,  Prev: Numeric expressions,  Up: expr invocation

Relations for `expr'
--------------------

   `expr' supports the usual logical connectives and relations.  These
are higher precedence than either the string or numeric operators
(previous sections).  Here is the list, lowest-precedence operator
first.

`|'
     Returns its first argument if that is neither null nor 0,
     otherwise its second argument.

`&'
     Return its first argument if neither argument is null or 0,
     otherwise 0.

`< <= = == != >= >'
     Compare the arguments and return 1 if the relation is true, 0
     otherwise.  `==' is a synonym for `='.  `expr' first tries to
     coerce both arguments to numbers and do a numeric comparison; if
     either coercion fails, it does a lexicographic comparison.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Examples of expr,  Prev: Relations for expr,  Up: expr invocation

Examples of using `expr'
------------------------

   Here are a few examples, including quoting for shell metacharacters.

   To add 1 to the shell variable `foo', in Bourne-compatible shells:
     foo=`expr $foo + 1`

   To print the non-directory part of the file name stored in `$fname',
which need not contain a `/'.
     expr $fname : '.*/\(^.*\)' '^|' $fname

   An example showing that `\+' is an operator:
     expr aaa : 'a\+'
     => 3

     expr abc : 'a\(.\)c'
     => b
     expr index abcdef cz
     => 3
     expr index index a
     error--> expr: syntax error
     expr index quote index a
     => 0

Redirection
***********

   Unix shells commonly provide several forms of "redirection"--ways to
change the input source or output destination of a command.  But one
useful redirection is performed by a separate command, not by the shell;
it's described here.

* Menu:

* tee invocation::              Redirect output to multiple files.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: tee invocation,  Up: Redirection

`tee': Redirect output to multiple files
========================================

   The `tee' command copies standard input to standard output and also
to any files given as arguments.  This is useful when you want not only
to send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy.  Synopsis:

     tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created.
If a file being written to already exists, the data it previously
contained is overwritten unless the `-a' option is used.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--append'
     Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting
     them.

`-i'
`--ignore-interrupts'
     Ignore interrupt signals.

File name manipulation
**********************

   This section describes commands that manipulate file names.

* Menu:

* basename invocation::         Strip directory and suffix from a file name.
* dirname invocation::          Strip non-directory suffix from a file name.
* pathchk invocation::          Check file name portability.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: basename invocation,  Next: dirname invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`basename': Strip directory and suffix from a file name
=======================================================

   `basename' removes any leading directory components from NAME.
Synopsis:

     basename NAME [SUFFIX]

   If SUFFIX is specified and is identical to the end of NAME, it is
removed from NAME as well.  `basename' prints the result on standard
output.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: dirname invocation,  Next: pathchk invocation,  Prev: basename invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`dirname': Strip non-directory suffix from a file name
======================================================

   `dirname' prints all but the final slash-delimited component of a
string (presumably a filename).  Synopsis:

     dirname NAME

   If NAME is a single component, `dirname' prints `.' (meaning the
current directory).

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: pathchk invocation,  Prev: dirname invocation,  Up: File name manipulation

`pathchk': Check file name portability
======================================

   `pathchk' checks portability of filenames.  Synopsis:

     pathchk [OPTION]... NAME...

   For each NAME, `pathchk' prints a message if any of these conditions
is true:
  1. one of the existing directories in NAME does not have search
     (execute) permission,

  2. the length of NAME is larger than its filesystem's maximum file
     name length,

  3. the length of one component of NAME, corresponding to an existing
     directory name, is larger than its filesystem's maximum length for
     a file name component.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-p'
`--portability'
     Instead of performing length checks on the underlying filesystem,
     test the length of each file name and its components against the
     POSIX.1 minimum limits for portability.  Also check that the file
     name contains no characters not in the portable file name
     character set.

   Exit status:

     0 if all specified file names passed all of the tests,
     1 otherwise.

Working context
***************

   This section describes commands that display or alter the context in
which you are working: the current directory, the terminal settings, and
so forth.  See also the user-related commands in the next section.

* Menu:

* pwd invocation::              Print working directory.
* stty invocation::             Print or change terminal characteristics.
* printenv invocation::         Print environment variables.
* tty invocation::              Print file name of terminal on standard input.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: pwd invocation,  Next: stty invocation,  Up: Working context

`pwd': Print working directory
==============================

   `pwd' prints the fully resolved name of the current directory.  That
is, all components of the printed name will be actual directory
names--none will be symbolic links.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The only options are a lone `--help' or `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: stty invocation,  Next: printenv invocation,  Prev: pwd invocation,  Up: Working context

`stty': Print or change terminal characteristics
================================================

   `stty' prints or changes terminal characteristics, such as baud rate.
Synopses:

     stty [OPTION] [SETTING]...
     stty [OPTION]

   If given no line settings, `stty' prints the baud rate, line
discipline number (on systems that support it), and line settings that
have been changed from the values set by `stty sane'.  By default, mode
reading and setting are performed on the tty line connected to standard
input, although this can be modified by the `--file' option.

   `stty' accepts many non-option arguments that change aspects of the
terminal line operation, as described below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--all'
     Print all current settings in human-readable form.  This option
     may not be used in combination with any line settings.

`-F DEVICE'
`--file DEVICE'
     Set the line opened by the filename specified in DEVICE instead of
     the tty line connected to standard input.  This option is necessary
     because opening a POSIX tty requires use of the `O_NONDELAY' flag
     to prevent a POSIX tty from blocking until the carrier detect line
     is high if the `clocal' flag is not set.  Hence, it is not always
     possible to allow the shell to open the device in the traditional
     manner.

`-g'
`--save'
     Print all current settings in a form that can be used as an
     argument to another `stty' command to restore the current
     settings.  This option may not be used in combination with any
     line settings.

   Many settings can be turned off by preceding them with a `-'.  Such
arguments are marked below with "May be negated" in their description.
The descriptions themselves refer to the positive case, that is, when
_not_ negated (unless stated otherwise, of course).

   Some settings are not available on all POSIX systems, since they use
extensions.  Such arguments are marked below with "Non-POSIX" in their
description.  On non-POSIX systems, those or other settings also may not
be available, but it's not feasible to document all the variations: just
try it and see.

Special characters
------------------

   The special characters' default values vary from system to system.
They are set with the syntax `name value', where the names are listed
below and the value can be given either literally, in hat notation
(`^C'), or as an integer which may start with `0x' to indicate
hexadecimal, `0' to indicate octal, or any other digit to indicate
decimal.

   For GNU stty, giving a value of `^-' or `undef' disables that
special character.  (This is incompatible with Ultrix `stty', which
uses  a value of `u' to disable a special character.  GNU `stty' treats
a value `u' like any other, namely to set that special character to
<U>.)

`intr'
     Send an interrupt signal.

`quit'
     Send a quit signal.

`erase'
     Erase the last character typed.

`kill'
     Erase the current line.

`eof'
     Send an end of file (terminate the input).

`eol'
     End the line.

`eol2'
     Alternate character to end the line.  Non-POSIX.

`swtch'
     Switch to a different shell layer.  Non-POSIX.

`start'
     Restart the output after stopping it.

`stop'
     Stop the output.

`susp'
     Send a terminal stop signal.

`dsusp'
     Send a terminal stop signal after flushing the input.  Non-POSIX.

`rprnt'
     Redraw the current line.  Non-POSIX.

`werase'
     Erase the last word typed.  Non-POSIX.

`lnext'
     Enter the next character typed literally, even if it is a special
     character.  Non-POSIX.

File: sh-utils.info,  Node: id invocation,  Next: logname invocation,  Up: User information

`id': Print real and effective uid and gid
==========================================

   `id' prints information about the given user, or the process running
it if no user is specified.  Synopsis:

     id [OPTION]... [USERNAME]

   By default, it prints the real user id, real group id, effective
user id if different from the real user id, effective group id if
different from the real group id, and supplemental group ids.

   Each of these numeric values is preceded by an identifying string and
followed by the corresponding user or group name in parentheses.

   The options cause `id' to print only part of the above information.
Also see *Note Common options::.

`-g'
`--group'
     Print only the group id.

`-G'
`--groups'
     Print only the supplementary groups.

`-n'
`--name'
     Print the user or group name instead of the ID number.  Requires
     `-u', `-g', or `-G'.

`-r'
`--real'
     Print the real, instead of effective, user or group id.  Requires
     `-u', `-g', or `-G'.

`-u'

`logname': Print current login name
===================================

   `logname' prints the calling user's name, as found in the file
`/etc/utmp', and exits with a status of 0.  If there is no `/etc/utmp'
entry for the calling process, `logname' prints an error message and
exits with a status of 1.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: whoami invocation,  Next: groups invocation,  Prev: logname invocation,  Up: User information

`whoami': Print effective user id
=================================

   `whoami' prints the user name associated with the current effective
user id.  It is equivalent to the command `id -un'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: groups invocation,  Next: users invocation,  Prev: whoami invocation,  Up: User information

`groups': Print group names a user is in
========================================

   `groups' prints the names of the primary and any supplementary
groups for each given USERNAME, or the current process if no names are
given.  If names are given, the name of each user is printed before the
list of that user's groups.  Synopsis:

     groups [USERNAME]...

   The group lists are equivalent to the output of the command `id -Gn'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: users invocation,  Next: who invocation,  Prev: groups invocation,  Up: User information

`users': Print login names of users currently logged in
=======================================================

   `users' prints on a single line a blank-separated list of user names
of users currently logged in to the current host.  Each user name
corresponds to a login session, so if a user has more than one login
session, that user's name will appear the same number of times in the
output. Synopsis:

     users [FILE]

   With no FILE argument, `users' extracts its information from the
file `/etc/utmp'.  If a file argument is given, `users' uses that file
instead.  A common choice is `/etc/wtmp'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: who invocation,  Prev: users invocation,  Up: User information

`who': Print who is currently logged in
=======================================

   `who' prints information about users who are currently logged on.
Synopsis:

     `who' [OPTION] [FILE] [am i]

   If given no non-option arguments, `who' prints the following
information for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal
line, login time, and remote hostname or X display.

   If given one non-option argument, `who' uses that instead of
`/etc/utmp' as the name of the file containing the record of users
logged on.  `/etc/wtmp' is commonly given as an argument to `who' to
look at who has previously logged on.

   If given two non-option arguments, `who' prints only the entry for
the user running it (determined from its standard input), preceded by
the hostname.  Traditionally, the two arguments given are `am i', as in
`who am i'.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-m'
     Same as `who am i'.

`-q'
`--count'
     Print only the login names and the number of users logged on.
     Overrides all other options.

`-s'
     Ignored; for compatibility with other versions of `who'.

`-i'
`-u'
`--idle'
     After the login time, print the number of hours and minutes that
     the user has been idle.  `.' means the user was active in last
     minute.  `old' means the user was idle for more than 24 hours.

`-l'
`--lookup'
     Attempt to canonicalize hostnames found in utmp through a DNS
     lookup.  This is not the default because it can cause significant
     delays on systems with automatic dial-up internet access.

`-H'
`--heading'
     Print a line of column headings.

`-w'
`-T'
`--mesg'
`--message'
`--writable'
     After each login name print a character indicating the user's
     message status:

          `+' allowing `write' messages
          `-' disallowing `write' messages
          `?' cannot find terminal device

format of the `%c' directive (described below).  Synopses:

     date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
     date [-u|--utc|--universal] [ MMDDHHMM[[CC]YY][.SS] ]

   If given an argument that starts with a `+', `date' prints the
current time and date (or the time and date specified by the `--date'
option, see below) in the format defined by that argument, which is the
same as in the `strftime' function.  Except for directives, which start
with `%', characters in the format string are printed unchanged.  The
directives are described below.

File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Padding,  Next: Setting the time,  Prev: Literal directives,  Up: date invocation

Padding
-------

   By default, `date' pads numeric fields with zeroes, so that, for
example, numeric months are always output as two digits. GNU `date'
recognizes the following numeric modifiers between the `%' and the
directive.

`-'
     (hyphen) do not pad the field; useful if the output is intended for
     human consumption.

`_'
     (underscore) pad the field with spaces; useful if you need a fixed
     number of characters in the output, but zeroes are too distracting.

These are GNU extensions.

   Here is an example illustrating the differences:

     date +%d/%m -d "Feb 1"
     => 01/02
     date +%-d/%-m -d "Feb 1"
     => 1/2
     date +%_d/%_m -d "Feb 1"
     =>  1/ 2


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: Setting the time,  Next: Options for date,  Prev: Padding,  Up: date invocation

Setting the time
----------------

   If given an argument that does not start with `+', `date' sets the
system clock to the time and date specified by that argument (as
described below).  You must have appropriate privileges to set the
system clock.  The `--date' and `--set' options may not be used with
such an argument.  The `--universal' option may be used with such an
argument to indicate that the specified time and date are relative to
Coordinated Universal Time rather than to the local time zone.

   The argument must consist entirely of digits, which have the
following meaning:

MM
     month

DD
     day within month

HH
     hour

MM
     minute

CC
     first two digits of year (optional)

YY
     last two digits of year (optional)

SS
     second (optional)

   The `--set' option also sets the system clock; see the next section.

Options for `date'
------------------

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-d DATESTR'
`--date=DATESTR'
     Display the time and date specified in DATESTR instead of the
     current time and date.  DATESTR can be in almost any common
     format.  It can contain month names, timezones, `am' and `pm',
     `yesterday', `ago', `next', etc.  *Note Date input formats::.

`-f DATEFILE'
`--file=DATEFILE'
     Parse each line in DATEFILE as with `-d' and display the resulting
     time and date.  If DATEFILE is `-', use standard input.  This is
     useful when you have many dates to process, because the system
     overhead of starting up the `date' executable many times can be
     considerable.

`-I[TIMESPEC]'
`--iso-8601[=TIMESPEC]'
     Display the date using the ISO 8601 format, `%Y-%m-%d'.

     The optional argument TIMESPEC specifies the number of additional
     terms of the time to include.  It can be one of the following:
    `auto'
          The default behavior: print just the date.

    `hours'
          Append the hour of the day to the date.

    `minutes'
          Append the hours and minutes.

    `seconds'
          Append the hours, minutes, and seconds.

     If showing any time terms, then include the time zone using the
     format `%z'.  If `--utc' is also specified, use `%Z' in place of
     `%z'.

`-R'
`--rfc-822'
     Display the time and date using the RFC-822-specified format, `%a,
     %_d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'.  If `--utc' is also specified, use `GMT'
     in place of `%z'.

`-r FILE'
`--reference=FILE'
     Display the time and date reference according to the last
     modification time of FILE, instead of the current time and date.

`-s DATESTR'
`--set=DATESTR'
     Set the time and date to DATESTR,  See `-d' above.

`-u'
`--utc'
`--universal'
     Print or set the time and date in Universal Coordinated Time
     instead of in local (wall clock) time.

Examples of `date'
------------------

   Here are a few examples.  Also see the documentation for the `-d'
option in the previous section.

   * To print the date of the day before yesterday:

          date --date='2 days ago'

   * To print the date of the day three months and one day hence:
          date --date='3 months 1 day'

   * To print the day of year of Christmas in the current year:
          date --date='25 Dec' +%j

   * To print the current full month name and the day of the month:
          date '+%B %d'

     But this may not be what you want because for the first nine days
     of the month, the `%d' expands to a zero-padded two-digit field,
     for example `date -d 1may '+%B %d'' will print `May 01'.

   * To print a date without the leading zero for one-digit days of the
     month, you can use the (GNU extension) `-' modifier to suppress
     the padding altogether.
          date -d=1may '+%B %-d'

   * To print the current date and time in the format required by many
     non-GNU versions of `date' when setting the system clock:
          date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S

   * To set the system clock forward by two minutes:
          date --set='+2 minutes'

   * To print the date in the format specified by RFC-822, use `date
     --rfc'.  I just did and saw this:

          Mon, 25 Mar 1996 23:34:17 -0600

   * To convert a date string to the number of seconds since the epoch
     (which is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), use the `--date' option with
     the `%s' format.  That can be useful in sorting and/or graphing
     and/or comparing data by date.  The following command outputs the
     number of the seconds since the epoch for the time one second later
     than the epoch, but in time zone five hours later (Cambridge,
     Massachusetts), thus a total of five hours and one second after
     the epoch:

          date --date='1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC +5 hours' +%s
          18001

     Suppose you had _not_ specified time zone information in the
     example above.  Then, date would have used your computer's idea of
     the time zone when interpreting the string.  Here's what you would
     get if you were in Greenwich, England:

          # local time zone used
          date --date='1970-01-01 00:00:01' +%s
          1

   * If you're sorting or graphing dated data, your raw date values may
     be represented as seconds since the epoch.  But few people can
     look at the date `946684800' and casually note "Oh, that's the
     first second of the year 2000."

          date --date='2000-01-01 UTC' +%s
          946684800

     To convert such an unwieldy number of seconds back to a more
     readable form, use a command like this:

          date -d '1970-01-01 946684800 sec' +"%Y-%m-%d %T %z"
          2000-01-01 00:00:00 +0000

`uname': Print system information
=================================

   `uname' prints information about the machine and operating system it
is run on.  If no options are given, `uname' acts as if the `-s' option
were given. Synopsis:

     uname [OPTION]...

   If multiple options or `-a' are given, the selected information is
printed in this order:

     SYSNAME NODENAME RELEASE OSVERSION MACHINE

   The OSVERSION, at least, may well be multiple words.  For example:

     uname -a
     => Linux hayley 1.0.4 #3 Thu May 12 18:06:34 1994 i486

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a'
`--all'
     Print all of the below information.

`-m'
`--machine'
     Print the machine (hardware) type.

`-n'
`--nodename'
     Print the machine's network node hostname.

`-p'
`--processor'
     Print the machine's processor type

`-r'
`--release'
     Print the operating system release.

   With no arguments, `hostname' prints the name of the current host
system.  With one argument, it sets the current host name to the
specified string.  You must have appropriate privileges to set the host
name. Synopsis:

Modified command invocation
***************************

   This section describes commands that run other commands in some
context different than the current one: a modified environment, as a
different user, etc.

* Menu:

* chroot invocation::           Modify the root directory.
* env invocation::              Modify environment variables.
* nice invocation::             Modify scheduling priority.

File: sh-utils.info,  Node: chroot invocation,  Next: env invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`chroot': Run a command with a different root directory
=======================================================

   `chroot' runs a command with a specified root directory.  On many
systems, only the super-user can do this.  Synopses:

     chroot NEWROOT [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     chroot OPTION

   Ordinarily, filenames are looked up starting at the root of the
directory structure, i.e., `/'.  `chroot' changes the root to the
directory NEWROOT (which must exist) and then runs COMMAND with
optional ARGS.  If COMMAND is not specified, the default is the value
of the `SHELL' environment variable or `/bin/sh' if not set, invoked
with the `-i' option.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: env invocation,  Next: nice invocation,  Prev: chroot invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`env': Run a command in a modified environment
==============================================

   `env' runs a command with a modified environment.  Synopses:

     env [OPTION]... [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     env

   Arguments of the form `VARIABLE=VALUE' set the environment variable
VARIABLE to value VALUE.  VALUE may be empty (`VARIABLE=').  Setting a
variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

   The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke;
it is searched for according to the `PATH' environment variable.  Any
remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.

   If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed.  This is like
specifying a command name of `printenv'.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-u NAME'
`--unset=NAME'
     Remove variable NAME from the environment, if it was in the
     environment.

`-'
`-i'
`--ignore-environment'
     Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited
     environment.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: nice invocation,  Next: nohup invocation,  Prev: env invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`nice': Run a command with modified scheduling priority
=======================================================

   `nice' prints or modifies the scheduling priority of a job.
Synopsis:

     nice [OPTION]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]

   If no arguments are given, `nice' prints the current scheduling
priority, which it inherited.  Otherwise, `nice' runs the given COMMAND
with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If no ADJUSTMENT is given, the
priority of the command is incremented by 10.  You must have
appropriate privileges to specify a negative adjustment.  The priority
can be adjusted by `nice' over the range of -20 (the highest priority)
to 19 (the lowest).

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-n ADJUSTMENT'
`-ADJUSTMENT'
`--adjustment=ADJUSTMENT'
     Add ADJUSTMENT instead of 10 to the command's priority.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: nohup invocation,  Next: su invocation,  Prev: nice invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`nohup': Run a command immune to hangups
========================================

   `nohup' runs the given COMMAND with hangup signals ignored, so that
the command can continue running in the background after you log out.
Synopsis:

     nohup COMMAND [ARG]...

   `nohup' increases the scheduling priority of COMMAND by 5, so it has
a slightly smaller change to run.  If standard output is a terminal, it
and standard error are redirected so that they are appended to the file
`nohup.out'; if that cannot be written to, they are appended to the
file `$HOME/nohup.out'.  If that cannot be written to, the command is
not run.

   If `nohup' creates either `nohup.out' or `$HOME/nohup.out', it
creates it with no "group" or "other" access permissions.  It does not
change the permissions if the output file already existed.

   `nohup' does not automatically put the command it runs in the
background; you must do that explicitly, by ending the command line
with an `&'.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: su invocation,  Prev: nohup invocation,  Up: Modified command invocation

`su': Run a command with substitute user and group id
=====================================================

   `su' allows one user to temporarily become another user.  It runs a
command (often an interactive shell) with the real and effective user
id, group id, and supplemental groups of a given USER. Synopsis:

     su [OPTION]... [USER [ARG]...]

   If no USER is given, the default is `root', the super-user.  The
shell to use is taken from USER's `passwd' entry, or `/bin/sh' if none
is specified there.  If USER has a password, `su' prompts for the
password unless run by a user with effective user id of zero (the
super-user).

   By default, `su' does not change the current directory.  It sets the
environment variables `HOME' and `SHELL' from the password entry for
USER, and if USER is not the super-user, sets `USER' and `LOGNAME' to
USER.  By default, the shell is not a login shell.

   Any additional ARGs are passed as additional arguments to the shell.

   GNU `su' does not treat `/bin/sh' or any other shells specially
(e.g., by setting `argv[0]' to `-su', passing `-c' only to certain
shells, etc.).

   `su' can optionally be compiled to use `syslog' to report failed,
and optionally successful, `su' attempts.  (If the system supports
`syslog'.)  However, GNU `su' does not check if the user is a member of
the `wheel' group; see below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c COMMAND'
`--command=COMMAND'
     Pass COMMAND, a single command line to run, to the shell with a
     `-c' option instead of starting an interactive shell.

`-f'
`--fast'
     Pass the `-f' option to the shell.  This probably only makes sense
     if the shell run is `csh' or `tcsh', for which the `-f' option
     prevents reading the startup file (`.cshrc').  With Bourne-like
     shells, the `-f' option disables file name pattern expansion
     (globbing), which is not likely to be useful.

`-'
`-l'
`--login'
     Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all
     environment variables except `TERM', `HOME', and `SHELL' (which
     are set as described above), and `USER' and `LOGNAME' (which are
     set, even for the super-user, as described above), and set `PATH'
     to a compiled-in default value.  Change to USER's home directory.
     Prepend `-' to the shell's name, intended to make it read its
     login startup file(s).

`-m'
`-p'
`--preserve-environment'
     Do not change the environment variables `HOME', `USER', `LOGNAME',
     or `SHELL'.  Run the shell given in the environment variable
     `SHELL' instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless the
     user running `su' is not the superuser and USER's shell is
     restricted.  A "restricted shell" is one that is not listed in the
     file `/etc/shells', or in a compiled-in list if that file does not
     exist.  Parts of what this option does can be overridden by
     `--login' and `--shell'.

`-s SHELL'
`--shell=SHELL'
     Run SHELL instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless
     the user running `su' is not the superuser and USER's shell is
     restricted (see `-m' just above).

Why GNU `su' does not support the `wheel' group
===============================================

   (This section is by Richard Stallman.)

   Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the
rest.  For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to
seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and
keeping it secret from everyone else.  (I was able to thwart this coup
and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't
know how to do that in Unix.)

   However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone.  Under the usual
`su' mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes
with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest.  The "wheel
group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of
the rulers.

   I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers.  If you are
used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you
might find this idea strange at first.

`factor': Print prime factors
=============================

   `factor' prints prime factors.  Synopses:

     factor [NUMBER]...
     factor OPTION

   If no NUMBER is specified on the command line, `factor' reads
numbers from standard input, delimited by newlines, tabs, or spaces.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: sh-utils.info,  Node: seq invocation,  Prev: factor invocation,  Up: Numeric operations

`seq': Print numeric sequences
==============================

   `seq' prints a sequence of numbers to standard output.  Synopses:

     seq [OPTION]... [FIRST [STEP]] LAST...

   `seq' prints the numbers from FIRST to LAST by STEP.  By default,
FIRST and STEP are both 1, and each number is printed on its own line.
All numbers can be reals, not just integers.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f FORMAT'
`--format=FORMAT'
     Print all numbers using FORMAT; default `%g'.  FORMAT must contain
     exactly one of the standarding float output formats `%e', `%f', or
     `%g'.

`-s STRING'
`--separator=STRING'
     Separate numbers with STRING; default is a newline.  The output
     always terminates with a newline.

`-w'
`--equal-width'
     Print all numbers with the same width, by padding with leading
     zeroes.  (To have other kinds of padding, use `--format').
